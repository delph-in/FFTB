- stephan wants -1's for all integer fields

- nothing should be saved to the profile until 'accept' or 'reject' is pressed, perhaps -- including decisions, comments, trees, whatnot

- come up with a story about why treebanking failed for some items in stephan's demo run... will have to try again on his machine, I think.
	- something about comments

- in case a span is selected and no discriminants are relevant *and* a unique tree is not available [yet] (so nothing is displayed), tell dan what we *do* know about that span
	- this can't be a constituent
	- this *will* be a constituent, and here's the unary chain for it -- and maybe more of the partially determined tree?

+ commandline revision
	--browser
	--items
	--gold
		--auto
+ exit button
+ comment editor
+ implement behavior of --items

- whenever a new span becomes underlined in annotation, check that the newly-unique tree for that span is actually unifiable.
- when reporting failed reconstruction, offer the failed rule name, argument position, path and types. also preferably show the derivation tree.
- allow rejection without narrowing to a single tree
- allow acceptance of all the remaining trees...?

+ write nothing instead of 0 when skipping an item
	[ ] should i maybe write a -1 to 't-active' when there is no tree record present, if there is a parse record? ... in profiles coming from stephan, if he cares about having a record there it will already be there. (shrug)
	ideal: UI shows status of each item, both in annotator view and list view:  accepted (>=1 t-active), rejected (0 t-active), unannotated (-1 t-active)
	        + status display done
		+ status should only be changed by explicit action... e.g. changing a discriminant can take you from accepted/rejected to unannotated, or clicking accept/reject can take you from unannotated to accepted or rejected
		+ next/prev should only visit unannotated items
- don't clobber results file ; if gold selected tree is not present, append it. otherwise noop.
- color code for: overconstrained but no active gold
- when multiple active gold trees exist, color coding becomes murky...
   - currently I compare to the first active tree and either show dark green or light blue.
   - should maybe be golden brown if multiple trees remain, or dark green/auto-accept if just one

things that *must* be done before any kind of release:
	[ ]   UI to select a gold profile for an update operation
	[ ]   verify that there is at least one *real* (reconstructable) tree left at each step, or *minimally* before saving
		-- actually, that could be expensive... if there is no reconstructable tree subject to the constraints, we have to rule out *every* remaining tree somehow or another.  we expect this to be rare except when there are very few trees left, so *usually* we should be fine... but it seems scary to try to offer a guarantee when it could take arbitrarily long to prove.
		+ we do it before saving, at least.
	[x]   save decisions; preferably in real-time as they are made, so you can return to your session from another browser or after the server is reset

strange bug:
	ws01 item 10030770 has 2 remaining trees (with all gold on), but no discriminants -- and all the lexemes are unambiguous.
		in that same item, and also in 10030700, there is another UI glitch where hyphenated words are being displayed incorrectly
	trec item 642 has 2 remaining trees but no discriminants
		- "at" can be at_date_p or at_temp -- two lexemes with different COMPKEYs but identical lexical types and identical predications
	ws01 item 10011280 claims 3 remaining trees, but two of them don't reconstruct

things that would be *nice*:
	various UI enhancements
	[ ] selective unpacking for verification of at least 1 valid parse, inspection of its probability, and possible acceptance thereof
		[ ] possible implementation: expand the current 'unary closure' forest expansion operation to also include a 'context' field for up to N grandparents and also the choice of which packed representative of the immediate daughters to use.  this would increase the in-memory forest size by a nontrivial factor, but would (maybe?) still be manageable...
			- plenty of advantages of this:
				- selective unpacking becomes very easy: best hypothesis for edge E is just ranked by its local score plus its daughters' best candidate scores.
				- feature forest-based maxent training becomes within easy reach... if we can store the feature forests for all the training items in memory. heh. at least we could extract the feature forests themselves.
				- the local context is large enough that some latent unification failures are likely to show up if they are locally replayed, allowing pruning of some of these edges
	[ ] allow selection of old-style discriminants (i.e. break down unary chains), optionally
	[ ] sentence-picker screen could show additional info about each item, e.g. number of parses, number of choices made, remaining ambiguity
	[ ] a way to see an example [sub]tree before picking a discriminant
		-- also perhaps an easy way to pull up the documentation for various rules/types
	[ ] overlay/display of other annotation types (ILG, PTB)
	[ ] write the labeled tree of the prefered unpacking to 'result'

improvements for special use cases:
	- display various types of prior annotations:
		- Emily would like to be able to view Inter-Linear Glosses along with the sentence being treebanked
		- Stephan would like to be able to view an alternate tree (e.g. PTB) for the same sentence


done:
	+ when saving, write 'decision', 'preference', 'tree' and 'result', including the derivation tree and the mrs of the preferred result
	+ keep a cache of TSDB profiles; much faster than loading everytime we change sentences
	+ apply gold inferred discriminants in addition to gold manual discriminants
	+ pre-parse sentences and store their forests, to avoid having to spend time parsing while user is on-line
	+ make sure we are supporting all the relevant old-style discriminants
	+ hilight sentence span when mouseover a decision
	+ speed up SVG rendering
	+ use parse-node labels for tree drawing
	+ display items with ambiguous tokenization properly
	+ UI to allow inclusion of *some* but not *all* the old discriminants
	+ item id display -- part of a prev/next/list interface
	+ show parse tree when disambiguated (also for substrings when requested)
	+ option to show *all* remaining discriminants (or, say, up to 20)
	+ show lexical types instead of lexeme names
	+ enable use of lexical type constraints from old tsdb decisions
